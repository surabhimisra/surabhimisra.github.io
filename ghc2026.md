# GHC 2026 Talk: Hardware Trojans in Silicon

This page collects the details of my proposed GHC 2026 session on hardware Trojans and secure chip design.

## Session Title

**Hardware Trojans in Silicon: Understanding the Threat and Securing Your Chips**

## Abstract

Modern chips power everything from cloud infrastructure and AI accelerators to consumer devices. As these systems grow more complex, hardware Trojans have become a quiet but serious security risk. Small and hidden hardware changes can leak data, alter behavior, or weaken cryptography while remaining invisible during normal testing.

This session gives a clear, beginner friendly introduction to hardware Trojans. We will cover what they are, how they can be inserted at different stages of the chip design flow, and why traditional verification may miss them. Using simple Verilog examples, switching activity observations, and logic locking ideas from my Hardware Trojan Lab series, we will walk through realistic Trojan behavior in a way that is approachable for students and early career engineers.

Attendees will leave with practical techniques for thinking about secure hardware, an understanding of how Trojans hide in real designs, and guidance on how to start exploring hardware security or ASIC design.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, attendees will be able to:

1. Explain what a hardware Trojan is and how it differs from software based attacks.  
2. Identify common insertion points for hardware Trojans across RTL, design, and manufacturing stages.  
3. Describe basic ideas such as logic locking and switching activity analysis that help reduce Trojan risk.  
4. Understand how a simple Trojan behaves in simulation and why rare triggers make detection hard.  
5. Outline next steps to explore ASIC design or hardware security through hands on experiments.

## Session Outline

1. Introduction to hardware Trojans and why they matter  
2. Where Trojans hide in modern chip design flows  
3. Simple Verilog examples of combinational and sequential Trojans  
4. Logic locking and secure design concepts  
5. Practical experiments from my Hardware Trojan and Logic Locking Lab series  
6. Approaches to building more secure hardware  
7. Learning and career pathways  
8. Q and A

## Target Audience

Students, early career engineers, hardware and embedded developers, and security curious attendees who want a practical and gentle introduction to chip security. No prior hardware security background is required.

## Speaker

I am an ASIC Design Engineer at Cisco working on high speed networking silicon. I explore hardware Trojans and logic locking through small experiments, open source labs, and beginner friendly writing. I have presented technical topics across Cisco, USC coursework, and community events such as USC Society of Women Engineers.
