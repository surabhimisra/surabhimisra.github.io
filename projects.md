# Projects

## Hardware Trojan and Logic Locking Lab Series  
Hands on experiments on Trojan insertion, sequential triggers, switching activity analysis, and logic locking using NEOS.  
Repo: [Hardware Trojan Lab](https://github.com/surabhimisra/hardware-trojan-detection-experiments)

---

## Security-Aware RTL Design for Hardware Trojan Mitigation  
Designed and evaluated security-aware RTL modifications to understand how hardware Trojans affect functionality and switching behavior.  
Explored simple detection strategies and logic locking based mitigation ideas.  
Tech: Verilog, testbenches, waveform analysis

---

## 4-Core Ring Based Multiprocessor  
Designed a bidirectional ring NoC router, NIC, and 32-bit CPU as part of a 4-core multiprocessor system.  
Performed synthesis and timing analysis at around 250 MHz.  
Tech: Verilog RTL, NoC architecture, synthesis

---

## RISC-V Processor  
Implemented a simple 3-stage pipelined RISC-V processor with stall, bypass, and annul logic.  
Tech: Verilog RTL

---

## CMOS SRAM Design  
Implemented a 512-bit 6T SRAM array with decoders, sense amps, and a layout optimized for noise margin and delay.  
Tech: Cadence Virtuoso, 6T SRAM

---

## RJ45++ Connector Extension (Cisco Innovation Challenge)  
Developed an intelligent RJ45 extension module for cable identification and asset tracking.  
Runner-up in Cisco’s company-wide innovation challenge.  
Tech: architecture, embedded system behavior
