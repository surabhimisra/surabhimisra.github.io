# Research Paper Summaries

Short, beginner-friendly summaries of hardware security papers I am reading.  
These are based only on public research and open-source benchmarks.

### 1. A Survey on Hardware Trojans (Tehranipoor and Koushanfar, 2010)

A foundational overview of hardware Trojans, triggers, payloads, insertion points, and the challenges of detecting small, rare-trigger Trojans.

### 2. Sensitivity Analysis to Hardware Trojan Using Power Supply Transient Signals

A study on how tiny, high-frequency power supply spikes caused by Trojan switching can reveal malicious logic, even when the payload never activates.  
Covers transient signatures, sensitivity analysis, PDN effects, and the strengths and limitations of this approach.
