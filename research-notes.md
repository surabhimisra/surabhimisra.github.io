# Research Paper Summaries

Short, beginner-friendly summaries of hardware security papers I am reading.  
These are based only on public research and open-source benchmarks.

---

### 1. A Survey on Hardware Trojans (Tehranipoor and Koushanfar, 2010)

A foundational overview of hardware Trojans, triggers, payloads, insertion points, and the challenges of detecting small, rare-trigger Trojans.

### 2. Sensitivity Analysis to Hardware Trojan Using Power Supply Transient Signals

A study on how tiny, high-frequency power supply spikes caused by Trojan switching can reveal malicious logic even when the payload never activates.  
Covers transient signatures, sensitivity analysis, PDN effects, and the strengths and limitations of this approach.

### 3. Restricting Switching Activity Using Logic Locking to Improve Power Analysis-Based Trojan Detection

Explores how logic locking reshapes internal switching patterns in a circuit and unintentionally makes hardware Trojans more detectable through power analysis.  
Shows how locked circuits have less switching noise, making Trojan-triggered switching easier to isolate and measure.
